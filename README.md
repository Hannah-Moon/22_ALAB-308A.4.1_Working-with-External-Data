# R-ALAB 308A.4.1 - Working with External Data

This graded assignment challenges you to create an interactive application using data from an external Application Programming Interface (API). In order to accomplish this task, you will employ the tools and techniques you have learned thus far, including fetch, Axios, and async/await syntax.



## Demo

## Tech Stack

**Environment:** VSCode, Git, GitHub

**Language:** JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap


## Objective

- Request data from an external API using fetch and Axios.
- Create an interactive, dynamic webpage that serves content from an external API.
- Use async/await and Promises to create synchronous logic in asynchronous actions.
- Using fetch or Axios, POST data to and DELETE data from an external API.
## Lessons Learned

Using Sandbox was challenging, and importing the code to the sandbox was even more so. The challenge that I encountered was

Improved clarity:

- Becoming familiar with the new sandbox environment.
- Refreshing the screen each time I write or revise the code to check its functionality.
- Even small comments appeared to cause errors in the sandbox, so I decided to delete them all.
- Converting the code to VSC requires additional effort to resolve any issues.
- Solving the problem was challenging due to the novelty of the tasks involved.
